Specific settings for libreoffice
---------------------------------

Using small scrollbars in libreoffice 3.* cause sheet tabs too small.

You can fix scrollbar width for LibreOffice two ways:

- run the script libreoffice-patch.sh.
This script will add customs application launchers for libreoffice in .local/share/applications.
The following command will be added in the application launcher:
# bash -c "GTK2_RC_FILES=$HOME/.themes/Zen/gtk-2.0/apps/libreoffice.rc application-command"
to uninstall and restore original files (if exist) run:
# ./libreoffice-patch.sh --uninstall

- edit Zen/gtk-2.0/gtkrc and change value of "GtkScrollbar::trough-border" from "2" to "3" for example.
