[b]Specific settings for libreoffice :[/b]
Using small scrollbars in libreoffice 3.* cause sheet tabs too small. You can fix scrollbar width for LibreOffice two ways :
- run the script libreoffice-patch.sh. This script will add customs application launchers for libreoffice in .local/share/applications. The following command will be added in the application launcher :
# bash -c "GTK2_RC_FILES=$HOME/.themes/Zen/gtk-2.0/apps/libreoffice.rc application-command"
to uninstall and restore original files (if exist) run :
# ./libreoffice-patch.sh --uninstall
- edit Zen/gtk-2.0/gtkrc and change value of "GtkScrollbar::trough-border" from "2" to "3" for example.

[b]Suggest for firefox users :[/b] install the add-on "GTK+ Native".
