The main goal of this theme is to keep it simple, consistent and being visually appealing.

Features :
 - thin menubar, toolbar and icons
 - compatibility with Xfce widgets, Xfce notify theme
 - six pre-configured color schemes compatibles with gnome and Xfce : Zen, Zen-blua, Zen-nigra, Zen-nokto, Zen-verda, Zen-papero.

This version use only the clearlook engine.

Install : extract the archive and copy the theme folders you want into ~/.theme.

Extras :
 - xfwm4 and metacity-1 windows decorator (see my others artworks)
 - Foxtrox icons. Install the package gnome-themes-extras if available or download the sources. Extract it and copy the folder icon-themes/Foxtrot/ into ~/.icons.

Specific settings for libreoffice :
Using small scrollbars in libreoffice 3.* cause sheet tabs too small. You can fix scrollbar width for LibreOffice two ways :
- run the script libreoffice-patch.sh (use it with care). This script will add customs application launchers for libreoffice in .local/share/applications to run the patch "libreoffice.rc" when libreoffice is launched. The folowing command will be added in the application lancher :
# bash -c 'GTK2_RC_FILES=$HOME/.themes/Zen/gtk-2.0/apps/libreoffice.rc application-command'
You can remove the generated files libreoffice-* safely.
- edit Zen/gtk-2.0/gtkrc and change value of "GtkScrollbar::slider-width" from "11" to "14" for example.
