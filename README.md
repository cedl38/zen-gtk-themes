The main goal of this theme is to keep it simple, consistent and being visually appealing.

Features :
 - thin menubar, toolbar and icons
 - gtk2 and gtk3 (version >=3.4)
 - compatibility with Xfce widgets, Xfce notify theme
 - seven pre-configured color schemes compatibles with gnome and Xfce : Zen, Zen-blua, Zen-griza, Zen-nigra, Zen-nokto, Zen-verda, Zen-papero.

The gtk-3 version is mostly tested on few applications under Xfce. Do not hesitate to try it in full gtk-3 environnement and report any issues.
The Murrine engine version >=0.98 is needed for the gtk2 version of this theme. A gtk2 version with the clearlooks engine is available on the Zen-0.3.x package.

Install : extract the archive and copy the theme folders you want into ~/.theme.
Arch users : "zen-gtk-themes" is available in AUR.

Extras :
 - xfwm4 and metacity-1 windows decorator (see my others artworks)
 - Foxtrox icons. Install the package gnome-themes-extras if available or download the sources. Extract it and copy the folder icon-themes/Foxtrot/ into ~/.icons.

Specific settings for libreoffice :
Using small scrollbars in libreoffice 3.* cause sheet tabs too small. You can fix scrollbar width for LibreOffice two ways :
- run the script libreoffice-patch.sh. This script will add customs application launchers for libreoffice in .local/share/applications. The following command will be added in the application launcher :
# bash -c 'GTK2_RC_FILES=$HOME/.themes/Zen/gtk-2.0/apps/libreoffice.rc application-command'
to uninstall and restore original files (if exist) run :
# ./libreoffice-patch.sh --uninstall
- edit Zen/gtk-2.0/gtkrc and change value of "GtkScrollbar::trough-border" from "2" to "3" for example.

Suggest for firefox users : install the add-on "GTK+ Native" to forces Firefox applied your theme.
