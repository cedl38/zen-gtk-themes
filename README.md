The main goal of this theme is to keep it simple, consistent and being visually appealing.

Features :
 - thin menubar, toolbar and icons

 - compatibility with Xfce widgets, Xfce notify theme
 - six pre-configured color schemes compatibles with gnome and Xfce : Zen, Zen-blua, Zen-nigra, Zen-nokto, Zen-verda, Zen-papero.

The gtk-3 version is mostly tested on few applications under Xfce. Do not hesitate to try it in full gtk-3 environnement and report any issues.
The Murrine engine version >=0.98 is needed for the gtk2 version of this theme. A gtk2 version with the clearlooks engine is available on the Zen-0.3.x package.

Specific settings for libreoffice :
Using small scrollbars in libreoffice 3.* cause sheet Tabs too small.
To fix the scrollbar width for libreoffice you have two options :
 - Run the script "libreoffice.rc"
add the following command in the application launcher :
# bash -c 'GTK2_RC_FILES=$HOME/.themes/Zen/gtk-2.0/apps/libreoffice.rc application-command'
 - edit Zen/gtk-2.0/gtkrc and change value of "GtkScrollbar::slider-width" from "12" to "14"
