Specific settings for libreoffice :
Using small scrollbars in libreoffice 3.* cause sheet Tabs too small.
To fix the scrollbar width for libreoffice you have two options :
 - Run the script "libreoffice.rc"
add the following command in the application launcher :
# bash -c 'GTK2_RC_FILES=$HOME/.themes/Zen/gtk-2.0/apps/libreoffice.rc application-command'
 - edit Zen/gtk-2.0/gtkrc and change value of "GtkScrollbar::slider-width" from "12" to "14"
